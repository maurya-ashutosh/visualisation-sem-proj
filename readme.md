# Visualisation Semester Project (Sept-Dec 2021)

## Chennai Mathematical Institute, India

The purpose of the project is to study and analyse the greenhouse emissions of countries, and compare it with
the occurrences of natural disasters around the globe. This can shed some light on the effect of harmful emissions
on the planetâ€™s ecosystems and their stability, which in turn leads to all kinds of natural disasters, from droughts
to floods.

The project is done in four components.

- ***Component 1*** consists of an explanatory data analysis of Greenhouse Emissions and Natural Disasters data using ```ggplot```. 
- ***Component 2*** consists of creating an RShiny dashboard using ```shiny``` and deploying it on ```shinyapps.io```. 
- ***Component 3*** consists of making advanced visualisations using ```Tableau```.
- ***Component 4*** finally consists of enumerating the key findings and highlighting major aspects of the project in a formal report.
